At Home with Friends
You are at home in your room with a few friends and lots of beer.
That really looks like a Mission. ;-)
Joe, Till, Dominik, Peter and Juliet are here.
You can see some bottles, your wall, and some beer here.

>GET BOTTLES
Taken.

>SET WALL TO 99
You line up all 99 bottles in a long row.

>SET BEER TO 99
You recheck the amount of bottles. YES! There are
99 bottles and all of them do contain beer.

>JOE, +BEER bottle(s) of beer on the wall,
Joe gets what you want and smiles.

>TILL, +BEER bottle(s) of beer.
Till nods. Joe and Till will sing the first two lines of the famous beer song.

>DOMINIK, Take one down, pass it around,
Dominik agrees, but Peter also wants to sing that line and freaks out.

>PETER, Shut up!
He calms down...

>JULIET, +BEER bottle(s) of beer on the wall.
She looks so sweet. I think she likes you.

>KISS JULIET
Now everything is ready for the beer song. Really everything?

>LIFT BOTTLES
Good job.

>ATTACH BOTTLES TO WALL
All bottels are save now.

>EXAMINE JOE
Joe sings his part and takes a sip.

>EXAMINE TILL
Till looks funny.

>EXAMINE DOMINIK
Dominik is tall and soon to be drunk.

>DROP BEER
First one done. Some more to come.

>EXAMINE JULIET
She sings her line, walks over to you and kisses you.

>DETACH BOTTLES FROM WALL
You empty the other 97 bottles in just about no time.
Now you might want to leave this place and find a party.

>QUIT
You have left the building.
